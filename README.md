## Question to resolve

This is a small research on what way of deciding
 initiative is the most
 advantageous to the players between two cases via procedure simulation. The
  more rounds players go first, the more advantageous it is for them.  
 
 ### Terms
 
 **Combat**: Combat is a sequence of rounds, where players take turns. After
  everyone on the combat took its turn, next round is proceeded until
   combat encounter  is resolved. In the simulation, I take 3 rounds per
    combat as an average from the experience. Combat usually consists of two or
     more conflicting parties. 
   
**Round**: Each combat consists certain number of rounds. It takes as many
 rounds as needed to resolve a combat. 
 
 **Initiative**: Order of actions is resolved with the initiative check. If a
  player wins, he goes first. If loses he goes after the enemies.
 
 **Check**: A player wins its check if rolls 100 sided die lower or equal than
  his
  character's stat. The only relevant stat here is speed. 
 
 ### First case
 
Players' initiative is decided each round in a combat. For N number of
 rounds, the player would need to roll N number of times.  

### Second case

Players' initiative decided only once per combat. This is the way when
 player would need to roll only once per combat. This giving him a chance to
  win all rounds per combat with only one check.
